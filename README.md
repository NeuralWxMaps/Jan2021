Height, Isotach and Precipitation fields for the month of January 2021

This is a historical record of which height, isotach and precipitation patterns occurred during the month of January.  The height fields are the 500 mb pattern identified by a Self-Organizing Map Neural Network that used daily height fields from 1948 through 1972 as the training dataset.  Likewise, the isotach fields are the 300 mb wind field identified by a Self-Organizing Map Neural Network that was trained with daily isotach fields from 1948 through 1972.

The precipitation fields, which only cover the western half of the United States of America are from an evolving SOM Neural Network that is using output from the National Weather Service's Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) as its training dataset. For plots in the month of January the data in the training dataset includes model output from mid-November 2020 through the end of December 2020.  One of the maps displayed is the dominant node of the SOM Neural Network, and the other plot is a selected ensemble member forecast from the dominant node.
